      'Photografted Zwitterionic Hydrogel Coating Durability for Reduced Foreign Body Response to Cochlear Implants',
    authors:
      'Adreann Peel, Douglas Bennion, Ryan Horne, Marlan R. Hansen, C. Allan Guymon',
    journal: 'ACS Applied Bio Materials, 2024',
    summary:
      'This study examines the durability of photografted zwitterionic hydrogel coatings on cochlear implants, highlighting their antifouling capabilities during insertion and long-term use. The research shows that these coatings significantly reduce frictional resistance and insertion force, leading to less trauma and scarring. The coatings maintain their enhanced lubricity and mechanical properties even after drying and rehydration, making them highly durable and effective in improving the performance and longevity of cochlear implants.',

      'Reducing the Foreign Body Response on Human Cochlear Implants and Their Materials In Vivo with Photografted Zwitterionic Hydrogel Coatings',
    authors:
      'Ryan Horne, Nir Ben-Shlomo, Megan Jensen, Morgan Ellerman, Caleb Escudero, Rong Hua, Douglas Bennion, C. Allan Guymon, Marlan R. Hansen',
    journal: 'Acta Biomaterialia, 2023',
    summary:
      'This study investigates the effectiveness of zwitterionic coatings in reducing the foreign body response on cochlear implants. After 1 year of implantation in mice, the zwitterionic coatings withhold their structural integrity while maintaining their anti-fouling properties. The coated cochlear implants show significantly reduce fibrotic capsule thickness and inflammation.',

      '​​Zwitterionic Photografted Coatings of Cochlear Implant Biomaterials Reduce Friction and Insertion Forces',
    authors:
      'Douglas M. Bennion, Ryan Horne, Adreann Peel, Parker Reineke, Allan Henslee, Christopher Kaufmann, C. Allan Guymon, Marlan R. Hansen',
    journal: 'Otology & Neurotology, 2021',
    summary:
      'This study demonstrates that photografted zwitterionic coatings on cochlear implant materials significantly reduce friction and insertion forces, leading to less trauma during implantation. The coatings achieved over a 90% reduction in frictional coefficients and a 40% reduction in insertion forces, suggesting improved outcomes for patients receiving cochlear implants. These findings support the potential for zwitterionic coatings to enhance the performance and safety of neuroprosthetic devices.',

    authors:
      'Braden L. Leigh, Elise Cheng, Linjing Xu, Alexis Derk, Marlan R. Hansen, C. Allan Guymon',
    journal: 'ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering, 2019',
    summary:
      'This study explores the use of zwitterionic polymers to coat PDMS surfaces, aiming to reduce the foreign body response and fibrosis that compromise implant performance. The photografted coatings demonstrated strong adhesion and significantly reduced protein and fibroblast adhesion, showcasing their potential to improve the biocompatibility of medical implants. ',

      'Antifouling and Mechanical Properties of Photografted Zwitterionic Hydrogel Thin-Film Coatings Depend on the Cross-Link Density​',
    authors:
      'Megan J. Jensen, Adreann Peel, Ryan Horne, Jamison Chamberlain, Linjing Xu, Marlan R. Hansen, C. Allan Guymon',
    journal: 'ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering, 2021',
    summary:
      'This paper examines how varying the cross-link density of zwitterionic hydrogel thin films affects their antifouling and mechanical properties. The study found that optimal cross-link densities provide a balance between mechanical strength and reduced protein and cell adhesion, essential for improving the biocompatibility of implanted biomaterials.
